// Package arena provides a low-level, relatively unsafe arena allocation
// abstraction.
//
// # Design
//
// See <https://mcyoung.xyz/2025/04/21/go-arenas/>.
//
// ArenasÂ are designed to only return pointers to data with pointer-free shape.
// However, we would like to store pointers in this data, so that the arena can
// point to itself (and to no other memory)
//
// This means that to store such data, the pointers must either live for the
// same lifetime as the [Arena] value (such as by storing them alongside it) or
// must point back into the Arena.
//
// We ensure this by making it so that holding a pointer onto any memory
// allocated by an [Arena] will keep all memory reachable from it alive.
// We achieve this by having the shape of each chunk allocated for the arena
// contain a pointer to the arena as a header; each chunk thus must have the
// shape
//
//	type chunk struct {
//	  memory [N]uint64
//	  arena *Arena
//	}
//
// By holding a pointer into chunk.memory anywhere reachable by a GC root (such
// as in a local variable) the GC will mark the allocation for the whole chunk
// as live, and therefore mark the [*Arena] field as live. Tracing through
// chunk.arena.chunks will mark all the other chunks as alive.
//
// Memory not directly allocated by an arena can be tied to it using
// [Arena.KeepAlive]. Using this operation is very slow, since this is the one
// part of the arena that is not re-used when calling [Arena.Free].
